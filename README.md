# dump1090-Web-Modern

The goal of this project is to create a clean and modern interface for dump1090. The current one actually dates from more than 10 years ago.

This web service will work with this version of dump1090 :
  - [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090)

It will also be possible to connect a **discord webhook** in order to receive information from your ADS-B directly on a discord server.

This project is currently being developed and many things can be changed, if you have any ideas for additions do not hesitate to contact me !
This website therefore aims to be very simple to set up and allow as many people as possible to benefit from a web version in tune with the times and which does not look like a good old windows 98.

I'm using script from https://github.com/Slord6/1090webclient to show airplane on the map.

**Do not hesitate to put a star if you like the project !**
